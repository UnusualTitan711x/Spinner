## 📖 Description

You have been trapped by a mad scientist to be experimented on. To escape the room, you must make use of your memory and proceed through the color boxes in the correct order. Fail to follow the sequence, and you'll be stuck here forever.

Also, a small warning... don't fall in the lava. I think that one is obvious.
